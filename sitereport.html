      <h2><center>Overview</center></h2>
      <p>Hello everyone,
      <br><br>
      I am Pradeep Raj Puri, and I am studying at University of Northampton.
      <br><br>
      I useld HTML and CSS to build this portfolio website because it is my University's
      assignment of web Development.

        <h2>Learning Experience</h2><br>
        <p>
          Learning HTML and CSS requires practice, and this adage proved true in my experience. Although I had 
          some prior knowledge, I faced challenges in putting it into practice. However, by committing to the 
          project and implementing planned strategies, I was able to improve my skills and gain more confidence. 
          Even using resources from the internet contributed to my learning.<br><br>
          In addition to HTML and CSS, I acquired knowledge of new ideas, design patterns, and shortcuts through 
          the project. I also learned how to use git, which made working with VSCode and managing my project on
          GitHub simpler. <br><br>
          Throughout the process, I tried various ideas and used the developer tool to inspect elements, which 
          allowed me to learn new concepts and enhance the visual appeal of my website. In summary, this project 
          was a valuable learning experience, and it has boosted my HTML and CSS skills.<br><br>

      <div id="module">
        <h2>Module Experience</h2><br>
        <p> In general, I enjoyed the module and found it to be a positive learning experience. However, there were
           times in class when I struggled to comprehend the material until I put it into practice myself.
           <br><br>
          Fortunately, the module teacher was always available to provide assistance and support. I found one of the 
          support sessions to be especially helpful as it gave me the opportunity to ask questions and receive immediate 
          feedback.
          <br><br>
          Looking ahead to the second term, I'm enthusiastic about exploring Javascript further and gaining more experience
           interacting with tags and elements.<br><br></p>

      <div id="design">
        <h2>Website Design</h2>
        <p>
          As a tech enthusiast and design lover, I've always been drawn to sleek and modern aesthetics. When I was first introduced 
          to the world of web development, I was captivated by the potential to create visually stunning interfaces that not only 
          looked great but also served a purpose.
          <br><br>
          During my first year of college, I was given a project to design a wireframe and prototype for a zoo management system. 
          Overall, my passion for design and technology continues to inspire me to push the boundaries of what's possible in web
           development, and I look forward to exploring new and innovative design concepts in my future work.<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="progress">
        <h2>Progress</h2>
        <p>I used VS Code to continuously create the HTML and CSS codes.
          <br>
          <img src="">
          <br>
          Throughout this project, I used a common css for body background, header, and footer for consistent page and design. 
          Then for each pages based on need I created different styling css files.
          </p>
